### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my web dev projects and improving my grasp over the german language( It is the most logical language I found after Javascript).
- ðŸ‘¯ You have a project and looking for a fresh pair of eyes for retrospection, just buzz me on my mail, I am 100% sure I will find a flaw!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my interest in basic law, we may end up working together.
